Concepts: (most to least ambitious)
1. VRCHAN:sandbox chatroom with the different boards as the rooms, you can move stuff, and just chill, post decals, and chat in a 3D room. Also, basic character creator

2.A Final Fantasy or Pokemon style JRPG with romanceable party members, takes place in the mind of some loser /g/ NEET.
Processors, OSes, othet hardware and software suites, become the Waifus(??).
Make the moves programming and hardware memes.
I.e. ((recurse)), repeat the last move, may cause overflow. //This anon is retarded

3.Cyber punk action rpg revolving around a gameplay loop of conquering territory run by android/cyborg gangs, exploring the conquered territory, and building the territory up. Waifu inclusion: gang bosses are waifus, personal questlines and character arcs tied to territory development.

5.Fighter or RPG, Yotsuba has to escape stallman-sama's basement, fighting her way through waves of gatekeeping neckbeards, Cniles, and lispfags/Yotsuba feel good adventure game.

6.An rts based on the spaceships from conways game of life. They seem so simple and have interesting patterns but you can't predict how a battle would end and who would win. Mostly it is inspired by some random videos I saw a few years ago:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FaqC4h5Ftg

7.An F-zero clone.

8.A rougelike game maybe with randomly generated waifu routes.



Ideas:

Must have Waifus,There shoud be a satania laughing gif everytime you lose the game
Magic based combat with randomly generated spells
An incel who wants to be popular but fails in the end
