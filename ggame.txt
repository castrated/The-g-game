Concepts:
1. A rougelike game maybe with randomly generated waifu routes(?)

2.An F-zero clone maybe with snes graphics?

3.Magic based combat with randomly generated spells

4.VRCHAN:sandbox chatroom with the different boards as the rooms, you can move stuff, and just chill, post decals, and chat in a 3D room. Also, basic character creator

5.Some Souls-like shit about an incel who wants to be popular but fails in the end

6.Fighter or RPG, Yotsuba has to escape stallman-sama's basement, fighting her way through waves of gatekeeping neckbeards, Cniles, and lispfags/Yotsuba feel good adventure game.

7.What about a Final Fantasy or Pokemon style JRPG with romanceable party members, takes place in the mind of some loser /g/ NEET.
Processors, OSes, othet hardware and software suites, become the Waifus.
Make the moves programming and hardware memes.
I.e. ((recurse)), repeat the last move, may cause overflow


Ideas:

Must have Waifus,There shoud be a satania laughing gif everytime you lose the game
