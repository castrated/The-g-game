IDEAS:
rou/g/elike

F-zero clone

magic based combat with randomly generated spells

Some Souls-like shit about an incel who wants to be popular but fails in the end

A sandbox chatroom with the different boards as the rooms, you can move stuff, and just chill, post decals, and chat in a 3D room. Also, basic character creator(vrchan)

The game would be about killing everyone and then playing a short arcade race section going to the next location.

fighter or RPG, Yotsuba has to escape stallman-sama's basement, fighting her way through waves of gatekeeping neckbeards, Cniles, and lispfags

roguelike VN with randomly generated waifu routes.

feel-good adventure game about Yotsuba

note to yotsuba adventure game: it's the core idea, you only included the degenerate shit

Maybe the game could be 8-bit?

No matter what we decide on, it MUST have waifus.

What about a Final Fantasy or Pokemon style JRPG with romanceable party members, takes place in the mind of some loser /g/ NEET.
Processors, OSes, othet hardware and software suites, become the Waifus.
Make the moves programming and hardware memes.
I.e. ((recurse)), repeat the last move, may cause overflow

There shoud be a satania laughing gif everytime you lose the game
