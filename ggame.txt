Concepts:
1. A rougelike game maybe with randomly generated waifu routes(?)

2.An F-zero clone maybe with snes graphics?

3.Magic based combat with randomly generated spells

4.VRCHAN:sandbox chatroom with the different boards as the rooms, you can move stuff, and just chill, post decals, and chat in a 3D room. Also, basic character creator

5.Some Souls-like shit about an incel who wants to be popular but fails in the end

6.Fighter or RPG, Yotsuba has to escape stallman-sama's basement, fighting her way through waves of gatekeeping neckbeards, Cniles, and lispfags/Yotsuba feel good adventure game.

7.What about a Final Fantasy or Pokemon style JRPG with romanceable party members, takes place in the mind of some loser /g/ NEET.
Processors, OSes, othet hardware and software suites, become the Waifus.
Make the moves programming and hardware memes.
I.e. ((recurse)), repeat the last move, may cause overflow

8.Rpg game in a living breathing dynamic city but its like the game 'lucius' where you hear voices in your head and have to serve satan by finding victims and sacrificing them to gain more psychic power and adrenochrome and the CIA helps you the whole time. 
All the npcs have oblivion type schedules so you have to do surveillance and stalk them and pick which ones to slaughter.
At the same time though you have to dodge the cops and angels of god who try to protect certain high value sacrifices.
I'm gonna be honest with you anon your idea is kind of retarded


Ideas:

Must have Waifus,There shoud be a satania laughing gif everytime you lose the game
